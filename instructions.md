### Important Files
- `.gitignore` - Lists files that Git should ignore
- `node_modules/` - Should always be in .gitignore
- `.next/` - Should always be in .gitignore

### Best Practices
1. Always write clear, descriptive commit messages
2. Commit frequently with smaller, logical changes
3. Check `git status` before committing to see what files will be included
4. Review changes with `git diff` before committing

### Useful Git Commands
- `git status` - Show the status of the working directory and staging area
- `git diff` - Show the differences between the working directory and the last commit
- `git add <file>` - Add a file to the staging area
- `git commit -m "message"` - Commit the changes with a message
- `git push` - Push the changes to the remote repository
